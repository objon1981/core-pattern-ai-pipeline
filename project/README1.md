# Core Pattern AI Pipeline

## 🌐 Overview
This project implements a modular, nature-inspired AI pipeline that simulates a core-forming process using:

- **Wavelet Transforms** for multi-resolution feature extraction
- **Graph Representations** for structured data abstraction
- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** to learn significant relationships
- **Fibonacci Compression/Expansion** to simulate centrifugal and centripetal natural forces
- **Fine-tuned LLMs** for explanation and interpretability
- **Feedback Mechanism** to refine AI understanding through user interaction

This architecture aims to uncover the core pattern of any dataset prior to model training, helping to improve generalization, interpretability, and data preprocessing.
